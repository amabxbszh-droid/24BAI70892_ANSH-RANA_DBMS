# EXPERIMENT – 03  
## Introduction to Oracle PL/SQL Programming

---

## Aim
To understand the basic structure of a PL/SQL program by creating and executing a simple PL/SQL block that includes declaration and execution sections, and to display output using built-in procedures.

---

## Tools Used
- Oracle

---

## Objectives
- To understand the basic structure of an Oracle PL/SQL block
- To learn variable declaration and initialization in PL/SQL
- To implement procedural logic using the BEGIN–END execution block
- To display output using built-in procedures such as DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE
- To strengthen foundational PL/SQL skills required for database programming, backend development, and technical interviews 

---

## Problem Statement 
Design and implement a simple PL/SQL program that demonstrates the basic structure of a PL/SQL block. The program should include a declaration section to define variables and an execution section to perform operations using those variables and display the results using appropriate output statements.

---

## Experiment / Practical Description

---

## Step 1: Declaration Section (DECLARE)
In this step, conditional logic is applied to classify entities based on their violation count. Each record is evaluated sequentially against multiple conditions and categorized into predefined severity levels such as no violation, minor violation, moderate violation, or critical violation.

Variables are declared and initialized:
- emp_id → Employee ID
- emp_name → Employee Name
- emp_salary → Employee Salary

---

## Step 2: . Execution Section (BEGIN ... END)
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE is used to display output.

## Course Outcome
This experiment provides hands-on understanding of the basic structure and execution flow of Oracle PL/SQL programs. Students develop proficiency in declaring and initializing variables, implementing procedural logic within PL/SQL blocks, and displaying output using built-in procedures, which are essential skills for database programming, backend development, enterprise applications, and technical interviews.
